<h3 align="center">ðŸ”¥ Fire detection project !ðŸ”¥</h3>
<div align="center"> 
  <p>The project was developed using various fire and smoke detection techniques. It is still in development!</p>
  <p>Using two Python scripts, the automation of image conversion from the current format to BMP was implemented for processing, and the number of images in the folder was obtained.</p>
  <p>For an image to be processed, it is sufficient to place it in the ./Images folder. Then, the Python scripts are called when the program runs, handling its preparation before being processed by the C++ program.</p>

  <p>Functions were created to facilitate data processing and visualization of results, as well as a menu that allows live navigation through the images in the folder and viewing the output.</p>

  <p>For fire detection, two techniques were used: one based on HSV encoding and another using the red color channel from BGR encoding.</p>
